# The most common mistakes and style problems were due to a lack of comments or 
# line length. Lesson learned :) 



For my calculator exercise:

The only problems were:

calculator_exercise.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)
calculator_exercise.py:1:0: C0115: Missing class docstring (missing-class-docstring)
calculator_exercise.py:5:4: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)
calculator_exercise.py:8:4: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)
calculator_exercise.py:11:4: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)
calculator_exercise.py:16:4: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)
calculator_exercise.py:21:4: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)
calculator_exercise.py:24:4: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)


Which, as I have understood mean that I haven't added enough comments to explain what is going on in my code.
The score was 6.40 (until I added the comments)


For the genism exercise:

genism_exercise.py:6:0: C0301: Line too long (172/100) (line-too-long)
genism_exercise.py:4:0: E0401: Unable to import 'gensim.summarization' (import-error)
genism_exercise.py:4:0: E0611: No name 'summarization' in module 'gensim' (no-name-in-module)
genism_exercise.py:6:0: C0103: Constant name "text" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
For some reason  the score was only 0.71 :(

The comments are pretty much self-explanatory. 



Nltk exercise:

nltk_exercise.py:14:0: C0301: Line too long (172/100) (line-too-long)
nltk_exercise.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)
nltk_exercise.py:14:0: C0103: Constant name "text" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
nltk_exercise.py:34:0: C0103: Constant name "grammar" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
The score was 8.40 so I didn't change much to improve it.



Pokemon code:

pokemon_code.py:5:0: C0301: Line too long (106/100) (line-too-long)
pokemon_code.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)

I got Your code has been rated at 9.23/10


SpaCy: 

spicy_exercise.py:9:0: C0301: Line too long (172/100) (line-too-long)
spicy_exercise.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)
spicy_exercise.py:9:0: C0103: Constant name "text" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
I only got 6.67
But after I added some comments and adjusted the line length and changed the constant name to TEXT, I got 10.0


Module TextBlob_exercise:


TextBlob_exercise.py:3:89: C0303: Trailing whitespace (trailing-whitespace)
TextBlob_exercise.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)
TextBlob_exercise.py:1:0: C0103: Module name "TextBlob_exercise" doesn't conform to snake_case naming style (invalid-name)

------------------------------------------------------------------
Your code has been rated at 6.67/10 (previous run: 6.67/10, +0.00)
Always the same mistakes oops. 



Module panda_file_code:

panda_file_code.py:4:0: C0301: Line too long (109/100) (line-too-long)
panda_file_code.py:31:0: C0301: Line too long (136/100) (line-too-long)
panda_file_code.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)

-----------------------------------
Your code has been rated at 7.86/10

Again, I added comments, but could not break file path lines. Therefore, I only improved my score up to 8.57 :(
